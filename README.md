simple:highlight.js
===================

A highlight.js package for Meteor that's integrated with the core `markdown` package and `chuangbo:marked`!

```
$ meteor add simple:highlight.js
```

### In Meteor 1.3+, use npm

In Meteor 1.3 and above, you can and should simply use the `highlight.js` package from npm directly! This Meteor-specific version is no longer maintained.

-------

### Using standalone

Call the methods as described in the Highlight.js docs: <http://highlightjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html>.

### Using with the Meteor markdown package or chuangbo:marked

This package is completely integrated with two markdown packages on the client and the server. Just put a code block in your markdown code:

    {{#markdown}}
    ```
    code goes here
    ```
    {{/markdown}}

And the code will automatically be highlighted. Provide a language hint by adding a keyword like this:

    {{#markdown}}
    ```js
    var x = function () {};
    ```
    {{/markdown}}

This package works not only with the markdown helper, but with the `Showdown.makeHtml` function in `markdown` called directly as well. This means it also works with `simple:markdown-templating`.

### Adding support for other markdown packages

Please file a pull request on the `markdown-integration.js` file!
